Pure-Rust JPEG / MJPEG **decoder + encoder**. No C, no FFI. Baseline and
progressive DCT, planar YUV in and out, with real quality and
chroma-subsampling control. **ESP32-compatible since 0.4.0:** `no_std` +
`alloc`, no libm, a decoder that reads a slice and an encoder that writes
into your buffer — see [Without `std` — on a chip](#without-std--on-a-chip).

This crate is a vendored merge of two upstream pure-Rust projects, carried
forward in-tree as one codec:

| Half | Upstream | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `decode` | [`jpeg-decoder`](https://github.com/image-rs/jpeg-decoder) 0.3.2 | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `encode` | [`jpeg-encoder`](https://github.com/vstroebel/jpeg-encoder) 0.7.0 | (MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND IJG |

See [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) for attribution and the IJG obligations, and
[`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md) for everything changed since vendoring.

> This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

## Performance

Measured against system **FFmpeg 8.1.2**, same machine, one pinned core each,
CPU time, the two binaries interleaved, paired win-rate with a z-score at
N &ge; 31.

| | vs FFmpeg | |
|---|---|---|
| **Encode** | **parity** — median 0.96&times; | matched output size (ours 3.1% smaller), fixed Huffman tables both sides; N=41, z &minus;3.59 |
| **Decode** | **parity** — median 1.02&times; | byte-identical bitstream, both arms discarding output; N=31, z &minus;0.18, inside noise |

Encode is measured on a 40-frame 1920&times;1080 4:2:0 clip at ~680 KB/frame;
decode on a photographic still stream-copied to 300 frames.

## Compression

Defaults match FFmpeg's MJPEG so the comparison above is like-for-like. Two
options trade encode time for smaller files:

| Option | Size | Encode time | Lossless? |
|---|---|---|---|
| default | baseline | baseline | — |
| `-optimize_huffman 1` | **&minus;7.4%** | 2.09&times; | yes — changes the coding, not the image |
| `-trellis 1` | smaller again | +144% | no — RD-optimal coefficient decisions |

Chroma is **box-averaged** on downsample rather than point-sampled. Point
sampling aliases detail above the subsampled Nyquist into the baseband and no
bitrate recovers it; averaging is worth **&minus;17.12% BD-rate** on
chroma-detailed content and **+2.30 dB** on saturated chroma edges, at no cost
in speed.

`-trellis`'s BD-rate (&minus;2.51% mean) comes from a synthetic corpus that
mispriced its *cost* by 46&times;, so treat the quality figure as unverified on
real material.

## Correctness

- The encoder is gated against the decoder as a **round-trip oracle**, in CI.
- Every SIMD kernel has a **scalar twin** and a test asserting they agree
  bit-exactly; the twin stays in the tree as the fallback.
- **NEON kernels are verified on real ARM hardware** in CI, not merely
  cross-compiled.
- A foreign-encoder corpus (libjpeg progressive and baseline, 4:4:4/4:2:2/4:2:0,
  greyscale, restart intervals, 1&times;1 to 255&times;127) runs through both
  decode paths; with 60 mutations per file that is 117,120 decodes, zero panics.
- `fuzz/` carries cargo-fuzz targets for `decode`, `decode_planar` and a
  round-trip; a deterministic mutation suite runs on stable in ordinary CI.

## Decode

```rust
use std::io::Cursor;

fn main() -> Result<(), rusty_jpeg::decode::Error> {
    let bytes = std::fs::read("in.jpg").expect("read input");

    let mut decoder = rusty_jpeg::Decoder::new(Cursor::new(bytes));
    let pixels = decoder.decode()?;
    let info = decoder.info().expect("populated by decode()");

    println!("{}x{}, {:?}", info.width, info.height, info.pixel_format);
    Ok(())
}
```

`decode_planar()` returns the YCbCr planes directly, skipping upsampling and
colour conversion — use it when the consumer wants planar YUV.

## Encode

```rust
use rusty_jpeg::{ColorType, Encoder};

fn main() -> Result<(), rusty_jpeg::EncodingError> {
    let pixels = [255, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 255, 255];

    let mut jpeg = Vec::new();
    let encoder = Encoder::new(&mut jpeg, 90); // quality 0-100
    encoder.encode(&pixels, 2, 2, ColorType::Rgb)?;

    std::fs::write("out.jpg", jpeg).expect("write output");
    Ok(())
}
```

Chroma subsampling (`SamplingFactor`), quantization tables
(`QuantizationTableType`), progressive mode, optimized Huffman tables and
trellis are set on the `Encoder` before `encode`. `PlanarYcbcrImage` accepts
planar YUV input (4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0) and `YuyvImage` / `ColorType::Yuyv`
packed 4:2:2 `YUYV` straight from a camera — neither takes a round trip
through RGB, and at the matching `SamplingFactor` the chroma reaches the DCT
untouched.

## Without `std` — on a chip

`default-features = false` makes the crate `no_std` + `alloc`. It builds for
`riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` (ESP32-C6 class) and
`riscv32imafc-unknown-none-elf` (ESP32-P4 class) in CI; the same code is what
an ESP32-S3 (Xtensa, via `espup`) or an ESP-IDF `std` build gets. It is the
JPEG half of the [Janus](https://github.com/Remade-With-Rust) camera pipeline
(`rusty_esp_video`). What changes:

- **The decoder reads a slice.** `Decoder::new(&bytes[..])` — any
  `decode::Source`, which with `std` is every `std::io::Read`. `scale()` is
  the important part on a chip: a 1600×1200 sensor JPEG decoded at 1/4 is a
  400×300 picture for a fraction of the work, and the full-size picture is
  never held.
- **The encoder writes into your buffer.** `SliceWriter::new(&mut buf)` is a
  sink with a cursor; `written()` says how much it holds, and outgrowing it is
  `EncodingError::BufferTooSmall`, never a truncated file. A bare `&mut [u8]`
  works too (it advances past what was written). A `Vec<u8>` still works.
- **No libm.** The few floats on the coding path were replaced by exact
  integer arithmetic, so a host and a chip code the same source to the same
  bytes — **provided the host runs the scalar kernels** (`--no-default-features
  --features std`, or `platform_independent`). The x86-64 SIMD kernels are not
  bit-identical to their scalar twins (the AVX2 forward DCT and the SSSE3
  inverse DCT round differently; a ±1 LSB matter), so a default host build is
  not the oracle for a chip. `tests/no_std_surface.rs` pins both rows: the
  scalar golden that `no_std` and `platform_independent` must share, and the
  SIMD golden.
- **No environment.** The `RUSTY_JPEG_*` knobs read as their defaults; the
  configuration is what you set on the `Encoder`.
- **No threads, no runtime CPU detection.** The synchronous worker and the
  scalar kernels — the same code every other build gates its SIMD against.

```rust
use rusty_jpeg::encode::{ColorType, Encoder, SliceWriter};

// `yuyv` is the camera's DMA buffer; `out` is the packetizer's.
let mut sink = SliceWriter::new(&mut out);
Encoder::new(&mut sink, 75).encode(&yuyv, 320, 240, ColorType::Yuyv)?;
let jpeg = &out[..sink.written()];
```

## Features

| Feature | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `std` | yes | `std::io` sources and sinks, the file constructor, the decoder's worker thread, runtime CPU detection, the environment knobs. Off: `no_std` + `alloc`, see above. |
| `simd` | yes | AVX2/SSE4.1 kernels on x86; NEON on aarch64. Implies `std`. Not bit-identical to the scalar kernels (±1 LSB); the scalar build is the oracle for a chip. |
| `rayon` | **no** | Decoder threading. Off because it measured slower at every image size — fork-join costs more than intra-frame parallelism buys. Implies `std`. |
| `platform_independent` | no | Drop arch-specific code, `forbid(unsafe_code)`. |
| `profile`, `counters` | no | Host measurement instruments (`rdtsc`, 64-bit atomics). Imply `std`. |

`Decoder::set_single_threaded(true)` selects the synchronous worker: ~38% less
CPU than the threaded default, which remains faster in wall-clock on a
multi-core box.
